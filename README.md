# Candidate Interview
Welcome to the Splice Frontend candidate code challenge!

The goal of this exercise is to get a sense of what it's like to work with you day to day. This repo contains a small angular application that has PRs made towards it. What we want to see is how you do code review. Talk through your process as a code reviewer. 

This challenge is a first for us and we haven't gotten timing and complexity right just yet. We might finish early or we might take a long time.  Neither of these things are indicative of your performance on the challenge. 

## Why a Code Review?
We could make you live code an insane algorithm in typescript, but that's not actually going to help us know what it's like to work with you. It's also not going to give you a good idea about what it's like to work here.  Live coding is more akin to a social experiment on stress and we aren't scientists. We sell music samples... 

## What are we looking for?
- Communication skills
- Catching bugs
- How comfortable you are just looking at some wacky code
- Suggestions on how to make code better

# Running this app
You can clone this exercise app so that you can run it locally. You will need to have node installed.

1) Clone the repo
2) run `npm i`
3) pray that went as expected
4) run the app `npx ng serve`
5) Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
